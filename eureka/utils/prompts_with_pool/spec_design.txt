The Python environment is {task_obs_code_string}.
The task is {task_description}.

Design some reward modules that will be included in the module pool.
Just provide the function specifications and a brief description of what each module does.
Each module should may named as "<aspect>_reward" for clarity.
Generate 4 to 6 different reward modules.

Tips for designing modules:
(1) Consider various reward shaping techniques, such as distance-based rewards, progress-based rewards, and task-specific rewards.
(2) Consider make use of every relevant state information available in the environment to design informative reward modules.
(3) Ensure that the modules are diverse and capture different aspects of the task.

The input variables for each module should only include attributes of the provided environment class definition (namely, variables that have prefix self.).
