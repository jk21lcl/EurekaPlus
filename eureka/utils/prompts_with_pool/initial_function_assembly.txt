Here is the created module pool, along with the specifications of each module.
{module_pool}

You should construct the reward function as a linear combination of the modules in the pool.
Please choose the most appropriate modules and decide their weights to construct the reward function for the given task.

Here are some tips for choosing weights:
(1) The weights should be non-negative, as all modules are designed to provide positive feedback for desirable behaviors.
(2) The weights should have balanced magnitudes to ensure that no single module dominates the reward signal.
(3) Consider the relative importance of each module in achieving the task objectives when assigning weights.
