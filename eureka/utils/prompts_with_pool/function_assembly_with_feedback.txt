Here is the modified module pool, along with the specifications of each module.
{module_pool}

You should construct the reward function as a linear combination of the modules in the modified pool.
Please choose the most appropriate modules and decide their weights to construct the reward function for the given task.
You can also refer to the training statistics of the previous RL training and the improvement plan to help you find the most promising modules.

Tips for selecting modules:
Consider including these modules in the final reward function:
(1) The modules whose reward values changed a lot during training, as they are likely to be more effective for RL optimization.
(2) The modules that were modified in the improvement plan, as they are expected to better align with the task requirements.
(3) The newly added modules in the improvement plan, as they may capture important aspects of the task that were previously missing.

Tips for choosing weights:
(1) The weights should be non-negative, as all modules are designed to provide positive feedback for desirable behaviors.
(2) The weights should have balanced magnitudes to ensure that no single module dominates the reward signal.
(3) Consider the relative importance of each module in achieving the task objectives when assigning weights.
