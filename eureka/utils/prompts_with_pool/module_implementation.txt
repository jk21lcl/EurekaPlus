Implement the python code for a reward module based on this specification:
{specification}

Rules for writing the reward module code:
(1) The module should only contain a single function that computes the reward and returns it as a torch.Tensor.
    Do not include any helper functions since the environment does not support them.
(2) The function name and input variables should match the specification.
(3) The code output should be formatted as a python code string: "```python ... ```".

Some helpful tips for writing the reward function code:
(1) You may find it helpful to normalize the reward to a fixed range by applying transformations like torch.exp to the reward
(2) If you choose to transform a reward component, then you must also introduce a temperature parameter inside the transformation function; this parameter must be a named variable in the reward function and it must not be an input variable. Each transformed reward component should have its own temperature variable
